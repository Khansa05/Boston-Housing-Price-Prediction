# Boston Housing Price Prediction (Models from Scratch)

This project implements **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models from scratch to predict house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model evaluation using RMSE and R², and feature importance visualizations for tree-based models.

## 📁 Files Included

- `BostonHousing.csv`: The Boston Housing Dataset
- `HousePricesPrediction.ipynb`: Code notebook with model implementation and analysis
- `Boston_Housing_Report.docx`: Report outlining findings, problems faced, and solutions
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies to run this project

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

## 📌 Features Implemented
- Data normalization & preprocessing
- From-scratch models (no sklearn regressors used)
- Feature importance for Random Forest and XGBoost
- Model performance comparison

## 🛠️ Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Khansa05/boston-housing-prediction.git
